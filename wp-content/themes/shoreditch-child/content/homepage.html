<h3>Private Tutoring</h3>
The tests are standardized. Our one-on-one tutoring is anything but.

<br>
<br> At its core, the SAT is a reading test—even the two math sections are full of word problems and questions about experimental
design. And while the ACT has a reputation as the more student-friendly college admissions test, it requires students to
be superstars at time management.

<br>
<br> For more than fifteen years, I’ve studied the ins and outs of both the SAT and the ACT and I’ve developed innovative strategies
and essential tactics to help students read as effectively as possible and to help students manage time, reduce stress, and
recall content. At COLLEGE TESTPLAN, I’ll customize these strategies and tactics to distinct learning styles so that students
achieve—and ideally exceed—their target scores.


<br>
<br> After an initial, complimentary Diagnostic SAT and/or Diagnostic ACT (or evaluation of previous scores), I will devise a
customized TESTPLAN leading into a targeted test date that caters to a student's respective strengths, needs, schedule, and
colleges of interest. These TESTPLANS are highly focused yet flexible, highly demanding yet practicable. &nbsp;
<h3>Semi-Private Tutoring</h3>
Same as the above except in a semi-private environment of two, three, or four students. Ideal for siblings, friends, and
teammates who share comparable baseline numbers. At COLLEGE TESTPLAN, parents and/or students themselves typically initiate
and arrange most semi-private tutoring.
